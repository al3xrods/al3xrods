#### üåê[Impact of Website Redesign.](https://github.com/al3xrods/Website_Redesign/blob/main/Website_Redesign.ipynb)
- Conducted an A/B test by dividing the user base into a control group (original design) and treatments groups (new design).
- Analyzed the results using hypothesis testing, chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact test.
- Results: Found a statistically significant increase in user conversion rate for the treatment group.

#### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è[Helping Reduce Employee Turnover](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/ec5ae7a2-89e0-47db-9452-6110a89b56ad)
 -  I used both Matplotlib and Seaborn visualizations to create histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps.
 - I performed several statistical tests, including the Bernard exact test and hypothesis testing, to identify significant differences between groups and test hypotheses about the data.
  - I also used the Scikit-Learn package for modeling, preprocessing the training and test data to avoid leakage.
  - The RandomOverSampler of Scikit-Learn imbalanced package was used for the imbalanced dataset.
  - I worked with several classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboost Classifier, SVMs, and XGBoost, to build a model that could accurately predict customer churn. 
  - Evaluated the models using various metrics such as ROC-AUC and performed hyperparameter-tuning to optimize model performance.
#### üíµ[Customer Segments for Marketing Campaign](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/66b04f38-08b7-4de4-b839-6f4da4d67275)
  -  Performed hypothesis testing to identify significant differences between groups such as Chi-square test of independence of variables.
  - Used SVD (singular value decomposition) for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms such as K-means.
#### üìù[Effectiveness of Test Preparation Courses](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/fc0be9da-682a-4725-948b-2c6708ec5660)
  In this data science project, I investigated whether test preparation courses were helpful at a large school. The school offered test preparation courses to students before major exams, and the goal was to determine if students who took the courses performed better on exams than those who did not.
 
  - I performed hypothesis testing using Python's scipy.stats package to test whether there was a significant difference in test scores between students who took the test preparation courses and those who did not. 
  - I also made sure to understand the statistical tests and assumptions, such as the normality of the data and the equal variance assumption.
  - I presented the data observations and findings in an insightful and comprehensive manner
#### üí°[Understanding Local Electricity Market](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/af6be56a-687f-4ea3-8a0d-2a1dadb79655)
  - The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was used to determine whether the time-series data was stationary or non-stationary.
  - The seasonal decomposition of time-series was used to separate the time-series data into its three main components: the trend component, the seasonal component, and the residuals.
  - The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) were used to measure the linear relationship between lagged values of the time series. These functions provide insights into the structure of the time series, including the presence of autocorrelation and the appropriate order of the ARMA and ARIMA models.
  -  ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models were used to forecast energy prices.
#### üç´[Comprenhensive Analysis on Chocolate Bars](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/83ec1596-1572-4d8b-a71e-71adcec067fe)
#### ‚òï[Finding Best Coffee Shop Location](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/5acb88ba-3302-42e8-8a07-9c7f34ff9ba0)
#### ü¶™[Estimating the Age of Abalone](https://github.com/al3xrods/Abalone-Age-Prediction)
#### üè•[Reducing Hospitals Readmissions](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/1dbd970b-fdc5-4d03-88ae-37838aff7330)

# üêçPython Projects.
#### ‚å®Ô∏è[Wallpaper Donwloader from Unsplash](https://github.com/al3xrods/wallpaper_donwloader/tree/main)
The script can be run in the command line, and it requires the user to specify the number of images they want to download and the theme of the images they want to download.

Once the user provides the required inputs, the script then proceeds to download the specified number of images from the Unsplash.com website. The images are then automatically moved to the specified folder, and the old wallpapers in the folder are deleted to make room for the new wallpapers. This ensures that the user's desktop wallpaper is constantly being refreshed with new and interesting images, without the need for manual intervention.
 
#### üìú[Quotes Scraper](https://github.com/al3xrods/quotes_scraper)
Using the BeautifulSoup package, the script then extracts all the quotes from the figure's page, and stores them in a text file. The user can then review all the quotes in the text file, and use them for whatever purposes they desire.

This project is written in Python, and it uses the requests package to make HTTP requests to the Goodreads.com website, as well as the BeautifulSoup package to extract the relevant information from the HTML page.
 
#### üîí[Simple Password Generator](https://github.com/al3xrods/password_generator)
 This Python code generates strong and secure passwords consisting of a random combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The user can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include or exclude certain character types. The generated password is displayed to the user and copied to the clipboard for convenience.
 
#### üìÇ[EPUB to MOBI Conversion](https://github.com/al3xrods/Calibre-Epub-to-Mobi-Conversion)
 This Python script is intended to automate the process of converting epub files to mobi format using Calibre application. This script is useful for Kindle users who prefer to download books in epub format and convert them to mobi using Calibre for better compatibility with Kindle devices.
 
# Currently Working on:
I am currently working on understanding how neural networks function, deep learning theory and algorithms, image preprocessing, and classification.
